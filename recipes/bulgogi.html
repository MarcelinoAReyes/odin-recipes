            <h3>Preparation!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine gochugaru, mirin, fish sauce, soy sauce, maesiaek, sugar, black pepper and garlic in a large mixing bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes. Gochugaru will absorb the moisture from the sauces and will become thick pasty sauce.</li>
                <li>Add pork and onion, mix well with your hand. Let it marinade at least 30 minutes to over night. Thicker the meat, longer marinate time.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over high heat, add cooking oil.</li>
                <li>Add marinated pork and cook until pork is fully cooked and onions are soften about7 to 9 minutes.</li>
                <li>Now, stir in green onions and chili. Cook additional 1 more minute and remove from heat. Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with sesame seeds and tiny bit of sesame oil. Serve with warm cooked rice, some lettuce for lettuce wrap and other Korean side dishes! I recommend kimchi, soy bean sprouts side dish and spinach side dish! Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
